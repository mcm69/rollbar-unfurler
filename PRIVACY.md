# Privacy Policy

No data, except access tokens, is stored by the app. The app *does not* have access to contents of any message posted in a Slack team the app is installed in, only to the URLs located at https://rollbar.com shared in a message. Any data obtained from Rollbar API to attach a preview to a link posted in your team is never persisted on the application server.

After you uninstall the app from your team, all the access tokens for your team are immediately deleted.
